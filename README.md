# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction System

## 🧩 Problem

Customer churn is a critical challenge for subscription-based and service-oriented businesses. Losing existing customers directly impacts revenue and increases acquisition costs.
The goal of this project is to **identify customers who are likely to churn** using historical customer data, enabling businesses to take **proactive retention actions** and improve customer lifetime value.

## 🔍 Approach

* Performed **data cleaning and preprocessing**, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
* Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand customer behavior patterns and churn drivers.
* Engineered relevant features such as tenure-based metrics, usage patterns, and service-related indicators.
* Trained and evaluated multiple **machine learning classification models** to predict churn probability.
* Optimized model performance with a focus on **recall and precision for churned customers**, ensuring better identification of at-risk users.
* Built a reusable prediction pipeline suitable for integration into business applications.
